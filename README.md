# Firefox OS Physical Web

![Searching for beacons](images/screenshot.png)

This is a rudimentary physical web application for Firefox OS.

## Todo

1. Add Eddystone, only does URIBeacons right now
2. Sort based on RSSI, rather than time found
3. Maybe remove beacons that go out of range for X seconds
